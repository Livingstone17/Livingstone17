### Hi there...I'm Samson Peter ðŸ‘‹

I am a UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer passionate about designing and developing solutions that makes life easier. 

I am skilled in designing,protyping, developing and testing multiple web-based applications using a range of technologies.                                                 
I basically code in JavaScript, use Figma/Adobe XD for UI Design and flutter/Dart for mobile development. I love challenging myself to build every product I design and to learn something new everyday.
At my free time, I study God and the laws of nature ðŸ˜„
