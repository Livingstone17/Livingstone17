### Hi there...I'm Samson Peter ðŸ‘‹

I am a UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer passionate about designing and developing solutions that balances aesthetics and functionality.

I am skilled in designing,protyping, developing and testing multiple web-based applications using a range of technologies.                                                 
I basically code in JavaScript and use Figma/Adobe XD for UI Design. I love challenging myself to build every product I design. At my free time, I study God ðŸ˜„

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing musical instruments(especially strings):musical_note: and teaching too.
