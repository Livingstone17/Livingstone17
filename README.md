### Hi there...I'm Samson Peter 👋
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He/Him

I am a Kony Infinity Developer and Frontend Engineer with strong experience building secure, scalable digital and SME banking solutions, and other solutions that makes life easier. I am passionate about turning complex requirements into clean, user-friendly, and reliable products.

I specialize in Kony Infinity architecture, Visualizer, and Fabric, with hands on experience developing, testing, and maintaining production grade digital banking applications. On the frontend, I primarily work with JavaScript and TypeScript, building responsive interfaces and well-structured user journeys using modern frameworks and best practices.

I enjoy challenging myself to fully build the products I design, continuously improving performance, usability, and code quality, while learning something new every day. I also have a growing interest in cybersecurity, particularly as it applies to digital financial platforms.

🌱 Currently learning AI/ML development and CyberSecurity practices.

💬 Ask me about JavaScript, TypeScript, Kony Infinity, React, Figma, and AI.

⚡ Fun fact, I love playing musical instruments, especially stringed instruments, reading, mentoring others, and studying God and the laws of nature 😄
